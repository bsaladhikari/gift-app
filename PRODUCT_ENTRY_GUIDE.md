*   **Write Exactly:** For lists (like Occasions, Interests), write the words exactly the same way each time (e.g., always "Birthday", not "birthday").
*   **Check Your Work:** Always look at the product details after you add them to make sure everything is correct.
*   **No Double Entry:** Try not to add the same product twice.
